My name's Garrett Baltz, I am a Berkeley-based Computer Science graduate from the University of California at Berkeley in 2024. Alongside my involvement in web development, I actively pursue hobbies such as french horn performance, jazz trumpet, and a career in Bartending. 

As an aspiring Software Engineer, I am currently developing a portfolio of projects to showcase my capabilities, particularly in web development, alongside expanding upon my real-world experience. Currently, I am prioritizing honing my fullstack capabilities through a few web applications (see LMNT) and hope to work in web development.

## Completed Projects
While I am still flushing out the breakdowns of each repository from my time at UC Berkeley, I have amassed a large amount of projects ranging from Git recreations, the Enigma machine, to Neural Networks. At the moment, I have only finished detailing my projects from CS188 - Intro to Machine Learning

- [CS188 - Intro to Machine Learning](https://github.com/grbaltz/cs188-sp23): Detailing the progression of my AI Pac-Man solver, CS188 consisted of 6 projects designed to slowly increase my comprehension of Machine Learning topics while building upon previous topics to evenutally culminate in an efficient, albeit simple, neural network to quickly and successfully complete Pac-Man.

## Current Projects

- [Loremaster Notetaker (LMNT)](https://github.com/grbaltz/LoreMasterNoteTaker):  A tool for game masters such as myself to quickly, easily, and intuitively build a world for roleplaying games such as Dungeons and Dragons. Planned features include: flexible backlinking, maps, loottables, dice commands, and more!
- [SipAdvisor](https://github.com/grbaltz/SipAdvisor): A personal application, SipAdvisor seeks as a way for one to track liquids taken throughout the day and determine how well one is taking care of themselves. Planned features include: simple drink logging, visual indicators of day-to-day progress, and daily/weekly/monthly statistics
