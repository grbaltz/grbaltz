My name's Garrett Baltz, I am a Berkeley-based Computer Science graduate from the University of California at Berkeley in 2024. Alongside my involvement in web development, I actively pursue hobbies such as french horn performance, jazz trumpet, and a career in Bartending. 

As an aspiring Software Engineer, I am currently developing a portfolio of projects to showcase my capabilities, particularly in web development, alongside expanding upon my real-world experience. Currently, I am prioritizing honing my fullstack capabilities through a few web applications (see LMNT) and hope to work in web development.

## Current Projects

- Loremaster Notetaker (LMNT):  A tool for game masters such as myself to quickly, easily, and intuitively build a world for roleplaying games such as Dungeons and Dragons. Planned features include: flexible backlinking, maps, loottables, dice commands, and more!
- SipAdvisor: A personal application, SipAdvisor seeks as a way for one to track liquids taken throughout the day and determine how well one is taking care of themselves. Planned features include: simple drink logging, visual indicators of day-to-day progress, and daily/weekly/monthly statistics
